Mongrel process title plugin
============================

This is a simple plugin for Rails which changes Mongrel's process title to reflect what it's currently doing. You can then determine a given Mongrel server's status using "ps". For example:

  mongrel_rails [10010/2/358]: handling 127.0.0.1: HEAD /feed/calendar/global/91/6de4
                 |     | |     |        |          |
                 |     | |     |        |          The current request (method and path)
                 |     | |     |        |
                 |     | |     |        The client IP
                 |     | |     |
                 |     | |     What it's doing
                 |     | |     
                 |     | The number of requests processed during the server's lifetime
                 |     |
                 |     The number of requests currently queued/being processed concurrently
                 |
                 The port that Mongrel is serving


Installing into a Rails Mongrel app
-----------------------------------

Nothing special. Just drop the plugin in vendor/plugins.


Installing into a non-Rails Mongrel app
---------------------------------------

Just require the module during startup:

  require "mongrel_proctitle"
